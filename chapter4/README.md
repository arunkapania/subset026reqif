# Issues

1. ProR does not support merged table cells which leads to strange RichText versions of several tables (e.g. those below `4.8.3` and the one in `4.10.1.3.e`)
2. Tracing into cells has not yet been implemented. Thus, the lists in some cells of `4.7.2.4[2].[t]*` were not properly extracted.
3. This chapter does not contain collisions but lots of skipped levels. So as soon as placeholders are implemented, quite a few tracestrings will change.
