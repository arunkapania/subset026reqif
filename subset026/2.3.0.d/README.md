subset026 - Baseline 2
======================

This is an alpha version of subset026 in its last Baseline 2 edition ([2.3.0.d](http://www.era.europa.eu/Document-Register/Pages/UNISIGSUBSET-026.aspx)).

Note that:

* links (SpecRelations) are not perfectly detected
* table matchers have not been adapted for this Baseline (so tracestrings are not always that pretty)
* files were produced with NLP turned off
* Some of the input files (indicated by a respective suffix) have their revision marking stripped. Without this modification the tool will not be able to process them (error is thrown) because their list numbering is ambiguous (both deleted and non-deleted paragraphs with the same numberText).
