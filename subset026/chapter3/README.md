# Issues

1. Images turned out to be problematic. 3 are still missing (OfficeDrawings which need to be extracted manually). The others sometimes suffer from kerning issues (i.e. the font looks messy).
2. The RichText editor in ProR does not show the images. Only the grid does.
3. Merged cells in table `3.13.10.4.10[2].[t]8` are not rendered correctly.
